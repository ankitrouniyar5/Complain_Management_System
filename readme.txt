The aim of this project was to make a computer generated webbased program with the blend of database management system and PHP. It can manage the details of the students, faculty and administrator members who can register themselves and all of this being supervised by the admin who have all sorts of rights to manipulate data. 
 This system can help the user to file a complaint and get feedback. 
 
All of this is done with the help of the front-end and back-end with the xampp as a server. We’ve implemented a three-tier client-server architecture, where the business layer (middle layer) is implemented through PHP. 
 
We’ve used PHPMyAdmin/MS SQL to store database using MySQL.
